# minecraft_modding
Personal minecraft mod that adds additional items/blocks with new features to the vanilla minecraft. I plan to add new functionnalities such as energy-generation/machines/engergy-transportation to turn the game into a automation-focused and resource-management styled game.
All the modding work occurs under minecraft_modding/AZI/src.
